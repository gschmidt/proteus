So what actually does happen if you disconnect for a day, and then
reconnect? Surely we want to resume your session, but surely we don't
want to send you every event that happened while you were gone and got
queued up?

Ensure connection is being kept alive

We're going to need to figure out how to keep session cookies alive
across server restarts!

Yahoo claims that XHR POST uses 100 Continue in major browsers. If so,
we need to change our stuff to use GET.

When server crashes with an exception, do something reasonable. Like
waiting for a code change?
